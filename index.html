	Products
        </h3>
<p>	Our portfolio includes <a href="https://www.ganttproject.biz">GanttProject</a>, 
	free desktop project management app, and <a href="https://papeeria.com">Papeeria, online LaTeX editor</a>
</p>
	      <h4>GanttProject</h4>
	      <p>GanttProject is a free project planning and project management tool for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux platforms.
		It is a good choice for small and medium  businesses which need to schedule their business tasks but can't afford
		high-end project management apps such as Microsoft Project. GanttProject is free for any purposes and is open-source</p>
	      <p>Despite that GanttProject can be downloaded for free, one can buy a downloadable package for any  price 
	      which seems to be reasonable to the buyer. The purchase is considered as funding of the application development.
	      </p>
	      <h4>Papeeria</h4>
	      <p>Papeeria is an online service for authoring scientific texts. It includes collaborative LaTeX editor, plot
		      building and bibliography management tools. Papeeria provides subscription plans, both free and paid.
